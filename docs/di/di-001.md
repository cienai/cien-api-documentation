## Query

### Query Intent

Explain how the query aggregates or filters data, what dimensions are used (e.g., team, role, stage), and which outcome metrics are calculated.

```sql
-- Replace this placeholder with the final SQL
SELECT
	/* dimensions */
	dim1,
	dim2,
	/* metrics */
	COUNT(*) AS records
FROM some_entity
GROUP BY dim1, dim2
ORDER BY records DESC;
```

### Sample Output

| dim1 | dim2 | records |
| --- | --- | ---:|
| A | X | 123 |
| B | Y | 45 |

## How to Interpret the Results

- Bullet 1 describing what a high/low value means.
- Bullet 2 linking the metric to a decision or next step.
- Bullet 3 calling out caveats or follow-ups.
