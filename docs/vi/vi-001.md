## Description

### Purpose of Analysis

Summarize the Value Intelligence question addressed (e.g., value allocation fairness, pipeline contribution), key fields, and decision context.

---

## Query

### Query Intent

Describe the dimensions (e.g., rep, segment) and the value metrics computed (e.g., new value received, opportunity potential).

```sql
-- Replace this placeholder with the final SQL
SELECT
	rep,
	segment,
	SUM(value_received) AS total_value
FROM vi_source
GROUP BY rep, segment
ORDER BY total_value DESC;
```

### Sample Output

| rep | segment | total_value |
| --- | --- | ---:|
| Alice | Enterprise | 1,200,000 |
| Bob | SMB | 450,000 |

## How to Interpret the Results

- Note on fairness or distribution of value across reps/segments.
- Guidance on how to act on high/low values.
- Caveats and recommended follow-up analyses.
